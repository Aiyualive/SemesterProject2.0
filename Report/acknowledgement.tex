%I reached out to Ian from literally the other side of the world, when I was still an exchange student at Tsinghua University in Beijing. When no professors seemed to be interested in supervising me for my final capstone project, he was happy to do so. He even offered to do a Skype call with me to discuss the available options for the project. I am truly grateful for his generosity in offering to supervise me.
%Ever since coming to Bristol University for exchange, he arranged weekly meetings to discuss project updates, answer any troubling questions, suggest important litterature and provide general clarifications. In general, great academic guidance was received and time were always made available if additional questions arose. These weekly meetings were very helpful and kept me accountable throughout the entire process.
%I appreciate his welcoming character, his attentiveness, rigorous scholarship and his ability to clearly explain answers to my questions. He truly is an expert in the field of visualisation and pattern recogni- tion; a master of his craft. I am truly humbled by his expertise and I have great respect for Professor Nabney.
