\section{Motivation}
Railway companies need to continuously and sufficiently maintain the train and the train tracks and opti- mally predict the future defects in order to have a more punctual and more effective train system. However, the current systems are expensive, time consuming and ineffective.

\section{Defects}
Defect can be of any type, which defects do we want to focus on
